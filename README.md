🚀 **A TypeScript ORM inspired by JPA – A Side Project for Learning**

## 📌 About BeeORM
BeeORM is a **TypeScript-based ORM** that I built as a side project, inspired by **Java's JPA.** One day, I thought it would be a great way to deepen my understanding of TypeScript by trying to create something similar.

This project is not meant to compete with or improve existing TypeScript ORMs—it's purely a learning experience. BeeORM uses decorators to define entities and properties, making database interactions more intuitive. It currently supports **MySQL** and focuses on **entity registration**,**metadata handling**, and **query execution**.

> **⚠️ Note:** This project is *not* intended to replace or improve existing TypeScript ORMs. It’s purely a learning experience!

✅ **Key Features:**
- 🏗 **Decorator-based entity definitions**
- 🗄 **Supports MySQL**
- 🛠 **Handles entity registration & metadata**
- ⚡ **Executes queries in an intuitive way**
