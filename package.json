  "description": "BeeORM is a TypeScript-based ORM that I built as a side project, inspired by Java's JPA. One day, I thought it would be a great way to deepen my understanding of TypeScript by trying to create something similar.\n\nThis project is not meant to compete with or improve existing TypeScript ORMsâ€”it's purely a learning experience. BeeORM uses decorators to define entities and properties, making database interactions more intuitive. It currently supports MySQL and focuses on entity registration,metadata handling, and query execution.",
